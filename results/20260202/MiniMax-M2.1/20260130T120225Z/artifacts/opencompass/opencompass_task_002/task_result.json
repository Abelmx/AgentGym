You can run the evaluation with extra `--dry-run` to download these datasets.\nCurrently, the supported datasets are listed in [here](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass/blob/main/opencompass/utils/datasets_info.py#L259). More datasets will be uploaded recently.\n\n#### (Optional) Automatic Download with ModelScope\n\nAlso you can use the [ModelScope](www.modelscope.cn) to load the datasets on demand.\n\nInstallation:\n\n```bash\npip install modelscope[framework]\nexport DATASET_SOURCE=ModelScope\n```\n\nThen submit the evaluation task without downloading all the data to your local disk. Available datasets include:\n\n```bash\nhumaneval, triviaqa, commonsenseqa, tydiqa, strategyqa, cmmlu, lambada, piqa, ceval, math, LCSTS, Xsum, winogrande, openbookqa, AGIEval, gsm8k, nq, race, siqa, mbpp, mmlu, hellaswag, ARC, BBH, xstory_cloze, summedits, GAOKAO-BENCH, OCNLI, cmnli\n```\n\nSome third-party features, like Humaneval and Llama, may require additional steps to work properly, for detailed steps please refer to the [Installation Guide](https://opencompass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/installation.html).\n\n<p align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">🔝Back to top</a></p>\n\n## 🏗️ ️Evaluation\n\nAfter ensuring that OpenCompass is installed correctly according to the above steps and the datasets are prepared. Now you can start your first evaluation using OpenCompass!\n\n### Your first evaluation with OpenCompass!\n\nOpenCompass support setting your configs via CLI or a python script. For simple evaluation settings we recommend using CLI, for more complex evaluation, it is suggested using the script way. You can find more example scripts under the configs folder.\n\n```bash\n# CLI\nopencompass --models hf_internlm2_5_1_8b_chat --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen\n\n# Python scripts\nopencompass examples/eval_chat_demo.py\n```\n\nYou can find more script examples under [examples](./examples) folder.\n\n### API evaluation\n\nOpenCompass, by its design, does not really discriminate between open-source models and API models. You can evaluate both model types in the same way or even in one settings.\n\n```bash\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"YOUR_OPEN_API_KEY\"\n# CLI\nopencompass --models gpt_4o_2024_05_13 --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen\n\n# Python scripts\nopencompass examples/eval_api_demo.py\n\n# You can use o1_mini_2024_09_12/o1_preview_2024_09_12  for o1 models, we set max_completion_tokens=8192 as default.\n```\n\n### Accelerated Evaluation\n\nAdditionally, if you want to use an inference backend other than HuggingFace for accelerated evaluation, such as LMDeploy or vLLM, you can do so with the command below. Please ensure that you have installed the necessary packages for the chosen backend and that your model supports accelerated inference with it. For more information, see the documentation on inference acceleration backends [here](docs/en/advanced_guides/accelerator_intro.md). Below is an example using LMDeploy:\n\n```bash\n# CLI\nopencompass --models hf_internlm2_5_1_8b_chat --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen -a lmdeploy\n\n# Python scripts\nopencompass examples/eval_lmdeploy_demo.py\n```\n\n### Supported Models and Datasets\n\nOpenCompass has predefined configurations for many models and datasets. You can list all available model and dataset configurations using the [tools](./docs/en/tools.md#list-configs).\n\n```bash\n# List all configurations\npython tools/list_configs.py\n# List all configurations related to llama and mmlu\npython tools/list_configs.py llama mmlu\n```\n\n#### Supported Models\n\nIf the model is not on the list but supported by Huggingface AutoModel class or encapsulation of inference engine based on OpenAI interface (see [docs](https://opencompass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced_guides/new_model.html) for details), you can also evaluate it with OpenCompass. You are welcome to contribute to the maintenance of the OpenCompass supported model and dataset lists.\n\n```bash\nopencompass --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen --hf-type chat --hf-path internlm/internlm2_5-1_8b-chat\n```\n\n#### Supported Datasets\n\nCurrently, OpenCompass have provided standard recommended configurations for datasets. Generally, config files ending with `_gen.py` or `_llm_judge_gen.py` will point to the recommended config we provide for this dataset. You can refer to [docs](https://opencompass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataset_statistics.html) for more details.\n\n```bash\n# Recommended Evaluation Config based on Rules\nopencompass --datasets aime2024_gen --models hf_internlm2_5_1_8b_chat\n\n# Recommended Evaluation Config based on LLM Judge\nopencompass --datasets aime2024_llmjudge_gen --models hf_internlm2_5_1_8b_chat\n```\n\nIf you want to use multiple GPUs to evaluate the model in data parallel, you can use `--max-num-worker`.\n\n```bash\nCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 opencompass --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen --hf-type chat --hf-path internlm/internlm2_5-1_8b-chat --max-num-worker 2\n```\n\n> \\[!TIP\\]\n>\n> `--hf-num-gpus` is used for model parallel(huggingface format), `--max-num-worker` is used for data parallel.\n\n> \\[!TIP\\]\n>\n> configuration with `_ppl` is designed for base model typically.\n> configuration with `_gen` can be used for both base model and chat model.\n\nThrough the command line or configuration files, OpenCompass also supports evaluating APIs or custom models, as well as more diversified evaluation strategies. Please read the [Quick Start](https://opencompass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/quick_start.html) to learn how to run an evaluation task.\n\n<p align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">🔝Back to top</a></p>\n\n## 📣 OpenCompass 2.0\n\nWe are thrilled to introduce OpenCompass 2.0, an advanced suite featuring three key components: [CompassKit](https://github.com/open-compass), [CompassHub](https://hub.opencompass.org.cn/home), and [CompassRank](https://rank.opencompass.org.cn/home).\n![oc20](https://github.com/tonysy/opencompass/assets/7881589/90dbe1c0-c323-470a-991e-2b37ab5350b2)\n\n**CompassRank** has been significantly enhanced into the leaderboards that now incorporates both open-source benchmarks and proprietary benchmarks.
